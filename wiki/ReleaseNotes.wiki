This page provides release notes for release of SVG Web

== Instructions for Updating This Page ==

At the top of this list is the entry 'In Development'. This will track the head of the repository with each issue that is fixed. As you fix issues just update this bullet list, where each bullet list should be in the form:

   * Issue X: "Title of Issue"

When we are ready to do a release, we can simply change the 'In Development' title to the release name, which will just be the date (svgweb-YEAR-MONTH-DAY.zip), followed by the final Subversion release number that the release was built from. For example, if we create a release on July 28th, 2009 from Subversion release r650, we would show:

svgweb-2009-07-28.zip (r650)
   * Issue 10: "Some Issue Title"

Be sure to link to the [http://code.google.com/p/svgweb/downloads/list download ZIP] for that particular release.
